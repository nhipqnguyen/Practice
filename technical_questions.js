What is the difference among COUNT, COUNTA, COUNTIF and COUNTBLANK in Excel?
    COUNT is used to count cells containing numbers, dates, etc.
    COUNTA is used to count any cell value containing numbers, text, logical values, etc. any type of value excluding blanks.
    COUNTBLANK will count blank cells or cells containing an empty string.
    COUNTIF and COUNTIFS count cells matching a certain criteria in the IF statement.

Is it possible to make a pivot table using multiple sources of data?
    Yes, but the multiple sources must at least be within the same workbook

What filter should we use if you want more than two conditions?
    The "Advanced Criteria Filter" will work for us to analyze the list or test more than two conditions.
