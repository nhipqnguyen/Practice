# 1-1. A psychologist wants to estimate the average dollar amount that a Visalia,
# CA resident would donate to a local homeless shelter. Twenty residents were
#randomly selected from the Visalia telephone directory which contains about
#30,800 names. The 20 randomly residents were contacted by telephone and asked
#how much they would be willing to donate. Their responses (in dollars) are given below.
response = "30 20 15 10 10 60 20 25 20 30 10 5 50 40 20 10 10 0 20 50"

# a) Describe the study population.
# b) Describe the population mean (𝜇) in the context of this study.
# c) A volunteer group has agreed to call all 30,800 residents and ask for a donation if there
# is strong evidence to suggest that 𝜇 > 15. Test H0: 𝜇 = 15. Report t, df, p-value, and your decision based on 𝛼 = .05.
# d) Compute a 95% confidence interval for 𝜇 and interpret the results.
# e) A similar study is being planned for the city of San Luis Obispo. How many residents
#should be contacted to obtain a 95% confidence interval for 𝜇 that has a width of $10.00?
#Use the sample variance (the squared standard deviation) from the Visalia study as the
#planning value for the population variance. Use R or hand compute Equation 1.6.
