# git
## 1. What is a commit message and why are they important?
### Commit messages are sent with each commit you make to a repository. 
### They're important because they allow other team members to see what code was changed and what was accomplished in your work.

## 2. What is a "git conflict"?
### A git conflict arises when there are two separate branches that have made edits to the same line in a file, 
### or if a file has been deleted in a branch but edited in another. Conflicts must be manually resolved before the branch can be merged into main.

## 3. What is "git stash"?
### Git stash takes a working directory and saves a copy of the changes so that you can reapply at any time if you need to.
